              "My Orthodox Medical Practioner (Nov. 30, 1954 - May 16, 2022), I can't believe that I'm living a life without you in it. Funny enough, you left without keeping any of your promises to me. If you were here, you won't want me to continue mourning. So, am just going to try to move on without you. Love you now and always! I placed the picture of your favourite artiste after you”

              "Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Known as the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot."
